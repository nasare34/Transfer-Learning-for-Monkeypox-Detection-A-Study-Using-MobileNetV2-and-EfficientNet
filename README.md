# Transfer-Learning-for-Monkeypox-Detection-A-Study-Using-MobileNetV2-and-EfficientNet

Introduction
The recent global outbreak of the Monkeypox virus (MPXV), a zoonotic orthopoxvirus, has raised significant concerns in public health. Early and accurate detection of Monkeypox from skin lesions is critical for timely intervention and disease management. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as PCR and clinical examination, can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Deep learning (DL) offers a promising alternative by automating the detection process and improving diagnostic efficiency.

Objective
The study focuses on leveraging pre-trained deep learning models for the binary classification of skin lesion images to detect Monkeypox virus infection (Monkeypox vs. Non-Monkeypox).
